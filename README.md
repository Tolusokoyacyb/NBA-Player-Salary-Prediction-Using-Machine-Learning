# NBA Player Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Goals of Project

Predictive Analysis: Develop a reliable machine learning model to predict NBA player salaries based on performance statistics and historical salary data.

Insight Generation: Provide actionable insights into salary trends by identifying overpaid and underpaid players, offering a data-driven perspective for fans, analysts, and decision-makers in the NBA.

Optimization of Player Valuation: Highlight inefficiencies in the current salary system by analyzing discrepancies between predicted and actual salaries, encouraging more equitable and performance-based contracts.

Skill Application: Demonstrate proficiency in machine learning, web scraping, and data analysis using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Model Performance: Achieve a measurable and meaningful model accuracy (e.g., 65%) to validate the reliability of predictions and allow for informed comparisons.

Data-Driven Decision Making: Support teams in identifying undervalued talent or overpriced players, potentially influencing salary negotiations or roster-building strategies.
